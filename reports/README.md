# Generated Assembly Reports

Generated using [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org) by concatenating `bit_field.hpp` and `tests/assembly.cpp`,
selecting a compiler, and compiling with the following options:

```
-std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -Warith-conversion -Wshadow -O2
```

The resulting assembly was copied into the report file, and then manually sorted to extract just the relevant pairs of
functions so that the manually-crafted code can be compared to the code generated by the library. The report files are
named like `{architecture}-{compiler}-{compiler_version}`.

These reports show that the code generated by the library is identical to the manually crafted code for every tested
invocation aside from label names, which must differ.
